Kaggle competition on Glass Type Identification
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/glass

Best scores obtained on a test set - classical models approx. 0.85, CatBoost - 0.9.
This is not the highest score, but as far as I understand from Kaggle comments that's the best we can reach with this data set.
(The data set is not very informative (214 samples in the train set))
